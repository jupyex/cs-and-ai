## Visual Studio Code
```
$code hello.c
$make hello
$./hello
```

1. Creating a file named `hello.c` . (It can also be used to open files)
2. Converting the code in `hello.c` to machine code for compilation
3. Running the machine code (which is in the same directory as our high-level programming file)
Note: If you change lines in `hello.c`, you have to type in `make hello` again to recompile the file before running the file.

```
$clear
```
The above command clears the whole terminal
