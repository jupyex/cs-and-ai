# Week 1 - C
## Where should you start with?
1. [Hello World!](hello-world.md)
2. [Conditionals](conditionals.md)
3. [Loops](loops.md)
4. [Mario Project](mario.md)
5. [Mathematical Computations](calculator.md)
## Problem Set and My Solution
1. [Mario Less](mario-less.md) 
2. [Mario More](mario-more.md)
3. [Credit](credit.md)  

My solutions are currently unoptimized, especially for [Credit](credit.md), there are a lot of repeated bits, and the functions are kinda duplicated. Do leave a comment down below if there you have any other alternative methods to solve the problem.
